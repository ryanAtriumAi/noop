// VitalityEngine.swift — a transparent 0–100 "Vitality" wellness score + an optional "Body Age in years".
//
// INDEPENDENT implementation of the published, peer-reviewed method WHOOP's "Healthspan / WHOOP Age" also
// uses (NOT medical advice; a wellness comparison, never a clinical biological age): map each wearable-
// measurable input to its published ALL-CAUSE-MORTALITY hazard ratio relative to a population reference,
// sum the log-hazards with an overlap correction (the inputs are correlated, so the naive sum overstates),
// and convert that combined hazard into a "years of aging" offset using the Gompertz mortality-rate
// doubling time (mortality roughly doubles every ~8 years, so 1 doubling of hazard ≈ 8 years of age).
//
// Body Age = chronological age + Δage. An average-for-their-age person nets ~0 and reads at their own age;
// healthier-than-average reads younger, less healthy reads older. Presented with a ±band and a hard
// "wellness trend, not a biological/clinical age" disclaimer, gated on a minimum number of inputs.
//
// Per-factor hazard ratios are taken from large cohorts / meta-analyses (UK Biobank, FRIEND, pooled
// step- and activity-mortality meta-analyses, sleep-regularity and HRV cohorts). They are deliberately
// CONSERVATIVE and the model is clamped, because this is a wellness estimate, not a diagnosis.
